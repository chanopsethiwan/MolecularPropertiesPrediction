We computed ECFP4 (Extended Connectivity Fingerprints, radius=2) using RDKit to characterize local atom environments across molecules. These 1024-bit vectors served as input features to classical ML models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and SVM. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using 5-fold cross-validation, and final model performance was evaluated using a consistent train/test split (80/20) across all 12 Tox21 toxicity targets.

Random Forest and XGBoost consistently outperformed linear baselines in terms of ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1-score, demonstrating the power of ensemble learning for molecular property prediction. These results serve as a robust baseline for future comparison with learned representations from graph neural networks (GNNs), which aim to replace engineered fingerprints with end-to-end training from molecular graph structures.
